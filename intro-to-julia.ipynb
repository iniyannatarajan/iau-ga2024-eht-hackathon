    "# A short introduction to Julia (for running Comrade)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a performant language with great support for scientific computing. While python is easy to develop with, for performance critical tasks we still look to languages such as C. The most widely used numerical computing package in python, `Numpy`, uses C primarily for performing high speed numerical operations. Julia eliminates this two language problem and combines the ease of programming of a high level language with the performance of a low level language.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to provide a quick introduction to some basic features of the Julia language that you would need to navigate and understand the [beginner level Comrade tutorials](https://ptiede.github.io/Comrade.jl/v0.10.4/tutorials/) without the specifics of the language getting in your way.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Jupyter, you can choose a Julia kernel instead of a Python kernel to run this notebook. If you are using a terminal, type `julia`, get dropped into the Julia REPL (this is the equivalent of the IPython interpreter) and start typing away."

    "A _method_ is a definition of one possible behaviour of a function. If you are familiar with object-oriented programming in python, you will remember that python allows the user to define _classes_. An instantiation of the class has specific values associated with its _instance attributes_ while the _class attributes_ are common to all instances of a class. _Instance methods_ are methods that can be called only on instances of that class. Classes can inherit from other classes which can override instance methods and different classes may have instance methods with the same name. This confusion is resolved by looking at the first argument of a method which denotes the class to which an object (instance) belongs. You will recognize this as the `self` argument in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can this behaviour be made more general? Envision a scenario in which the method that gets invoked is determined by looking not only at the first argument passed to a function, but _all_ of them. This is called **_multiple dispatch_** and is what Julia does. Instead of defining classes with associated attributes and methods, you can create composite data types (a `struct`) and write methods with different _signatures_ (number and type of arguments passed) to accomplish the same and even more. More on this can be found in [this entertaining talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY)."
